      <p>My name is Joshua Comish, and I am a student at Brigham Young University-Idaho.  I grew up in the military,
         so I can't really say I am from anywhere.  I have lived in Kansas, Germany, Pennsylvania, Maryland,
         and South Carolina.  I am currently living in Texas, right in between San Antonio and Austin.  I am studying 
         Software Engineering and Business Administration, and I graduate this semester.
         I am currently working full time for a data security company called Futurex.  I am loving 
         my job, and I am always super busy.</p>
      <p>Programming has always fastinated me.  I have done a lot of programming on my own time, and I have two personal projects that are currently on the market.  I also have a passion for music.  I love living near Austin where I can follow my favorite kinds of music. </p>
